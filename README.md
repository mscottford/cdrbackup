# cdrbackup
bash script to archive an audio cd

This script has only been tested on macOS.

Still very much a work in progress.

## Dependencies

* `brew install lame`
* `brew install cdrdao`
* `brew install bchunk`
* `diskutil` installed by default on macOS - permits unmounting audio CDs without having to be `root`
